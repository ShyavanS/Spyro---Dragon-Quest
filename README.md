# Spyro-Dragon-Quest
My first self-taught game using PyGame based around a character from a PS1 game.

A game I made for an entrepreneurial project in Grade 8 based on Spyro the Dragon and made in Python using PyGame. It is a 2D platformer in a similar fashion to the Donkey Kong arcade game (but much worse as I didn't know at all what I was doing at the time!).

The enemies fire really fast and there are only two unique levels, one of which is the final boss. The other three levels are all reskins of each other and only the first and final levels run smoothly, the framerate drops drastically for the middle two and I could not figure out why at the time.

I distributed the games on disc after compiling them to run on Windows machines using PyInstaller and initally they ran directly off the disc as I did not know how to make an installer application. I later figured that out and made it install to the computer and distributed the installer on disc still since I had a large amount of leftover discs.
